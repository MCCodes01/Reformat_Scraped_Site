# Reformat_Scraped_Site
Text Reformatting Script

This Python script reads text from an input file, reformats it by adjusting spaces and adding appropriate line breaks, and then writes the formatted text to an output file. The script provides feedback throughout the process to indicate the progress of the operation.

Features

Reads text from a specified input file.
Replaces multiple spaces with a single space.
Adds double line breaks after periods, question marks, and exclamation marks to create readable paragraphs.
Optionally reformats headings (e.g., adds line breaks before and after headings ending with a colon :).
Writes the reformatted text to a specified output file.
Provides detailed feedback during execution.
Prerequisites

Python 3.6 or higher.

Usage:

Save the Script: Ensure the script is saved in a .py file, for example, reformat_text.py.
Prepare the Input File: Create or obtain a text file containing the content you want to reformat (e.g., scraped_text.txt).
Run the Script: Execute the script with Python, specifying the input and output file names.
Example
python
Copy code
input_file = "scraped_text.txt"
output_file = "reformatted_text.txt"
reformat_text(input_file, output_file)
The script will read the content from scraped_text.txt, process it, and save the reformatted text to reformatted_text.txt.
Feedback

During the execution, the script will output messages to the console to inform you about the current step being processed, such as reading the file, replacing spaces, and writing the output.

Error Handling

If any error occurs during the execution, the script will catch the exception and print an error message indicating what went wrong.
